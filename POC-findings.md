# Pros
    1. Operator-assisted deployments and run time
    2. Low code integration
    3. Built on popular open source projects
    4. Strong Visual Studio Code IDE integration

# Cons
    1. Several operators and components still in tech preview or newly GA'd
    2. High learning curve to leverage / fine tune integration components
        E.g. managing kamel traits through -t parameter
    3. Not sure how to tune error handling for Camel K operator
    4. Camel K service mode not available in multi-tenancy setup
