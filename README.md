# jpss-red-hat-integration-poc
Justice and Public Safety Sector Red Hat Integration POC repository

# Introduction

This Proof of concept (POC) project explores implementing the following areas of integration using Red Hat Integration Tool Kit:
- ## Enterprise Integration
  - Comprehensive connectors
  - Microservices orchestration
  - Data Transformation
  - Low-code iPaaS
  - Kubernetes connectivity with Camel K
  

# Documentation

- [Red Hat GitOps](https://github.com/redhat-developer/gitops-operator)

This POC project will use the following Red Hat Integration Tools to implement:
- Compute: Camel K
- Event Broker: Red Hat AMQ Streams (Kafka)
- Service and Schema Registry: Red Hat Service Registry (Apicur.io)

## Considerations
  - [Apache Kafka Architecture - Delivery Guarantees](https://supergloo.com/kafka/kafka-architecture-delivery/)
    - at most once - which can lead to messages being lost, but they cannot be redelivered or duplicated
    - at least once - ensures messages are never lost but may be duplicated
    - exactly once - guarantees each message processing (not delivery) happens once and only once

# Kafkacat usage

<pre>
oc run kafkacat -it --rm --restart=Never --image=edenhill/kafkacat:1.6.0 --command â€“ /bin/sh

alias kafkacat='oc exec kafkacat -it -- kafkacat'

kafkacat -b cmn-kafka-kafka-bootstrap:9092 -t my-topic -C 
</pre>

Note: Need to run this in a real Linux shell; e.g. a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) session, rather than a Git Bash (emulation) session


# POC Scope
![](/img/dems-integration-context-diagram.png)

This POC will implement a simple set of court case management (CCM) services.  Specifically, the POC will cover the following two services:
- Notification Service
- Lookup Service

# POC System Context Diagram

Below is the system context diagram for the DEMS Integration POC where the following event-based solution is implemented using Red Hat Integration toolkit:

- **Actors**
  - JUSTIN System
  - DEMS User

- **Events / Commands**
  - Court Case Created
  - Get Court Case Details

- **Domain Services**
  - Notification Service
  - Lookup Service

- **Event Topics**
  - Court Cases
  - KPIs (no personal information)
  - Audits
